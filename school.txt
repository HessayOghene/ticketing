This is a test git file for cohort 8. The expectation is that at the end of this lecture, we would have:
1. refreshed our memory of the last class
2. learnt about git branches
3. open a git repository
4. push our code from the local repository to the remote repository
5. I will keep practising until I master this.
6. I want to be a Devops engineer.
7. Git is an interesting course to learn.
